# Richard van Nieuwenhoven

This is my personal site where I collect the projects I am working on 
currently. They are base located in github and on sourceforge. This site 
hosts a copy of the sites of these projects under the reverse maven 
groupId domain.

I noticed that specially scientific Java projects have problems 
deploying the code to the public, and are just publishing there jars as 
they are. When I "need" such a project, I will try to help the 
developers to get the project on a public platform like sourceforge or 
github, and setup the system so they can deploy to the central repository.

novaforjava is a general purpose, double precision, Celestial Mechanics, Astrometry and Astrodynamics library. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/novaforjava]

[![ptp4j](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/ptp4j/icon)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ptp4j) ptp4j

This is a platform independent library Java library implementing the PTP/MTP/PTP2 protocol to communicate with camera devices. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/ptp4j]

[![jenesis4java](https://a.fsdn.com/allura/p/jenesis4java/icon)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jenesis4java) jenesis4java

This a republished version of the inxar tool jenesis, because the original library is not available in the internet anymore. It is a Library to generate Java 8 code using a simple to use domain object model. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/jenesis4java]

NanoHTTPD is a light-weight HTTP server designed for embedding in other applications. [http://www.nanohttpd.org/]

[![nom-tam-fits](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10752167?v=3&s=84)](https://github.com/nom-tam-fits/nom-tam-fits) nom-tam-fits

Pure java Java library for reading and writing FITS files. FITS, the Flexible Image Transport System, is the format commonly used in the archiving and transport of astronomical data. [https://github.com/nom-tam-fits/nom-tam-fits]

[![jwifisd](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/10893363?v=3&s=84)](https://github.com/jwifisd/jwifisd) jwifisd

JWiFiSD is a generic pure Java library API to access the different wifi-sd cards available on the market in a transparent way. The Java developer using the library does not have to know the specifics of the differed cards. They will be detected automatically and appropriate events are send back over the Java API.

[![quickhull3d](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9456789?v=3&s=84)](https://github.com/Quickhull3d/quickhull3d) quickhull3d

This is a 3D implementation of QuickHull for Java, based on the original paper by Barber, Dobkin, and Huhdanpaa and the C implementation known as qhull. The algorithm has O(n log(n)) complexity, works with double precision numbers, is fairly robust with respect to degenerate situations, and allows the merging of co-planar faces.

If you have such a scientific Java project, feel free to ask me for 
help. I will at least try to help you with examples and when the project 
takes my special interest I will take hand to the migration.

Photos are not my thing so my avatar I always use is this:

It was part of a poster with the subtitle:

"to all oppressed animals in this bestial universe, defend yourself"

As i am vegan I endorse this, with absolute conviction!.
